# Inventory-monitoring-web-application

This was my first full-stack project completed during my software engineering internship. 

On the back-end side, I used Python and SQLite API to extract sales data and inventory records from the company's ERM system. Then, I built a well-structured database to store them, which could be manipulated by the inventory monitoring function I wrote in Python.

On the front-end side, I utilized the Streamlit framework to design my web application and to demonstrate back-end functions in terms of inventory alarms, sales analysis, and acquisition forecasting.
